**Important: Please report feature requests in https://github.com/cineafx/CINE_addizeus/issues/1**

### Before reporting

- Any and all requests should be done in the designated feature request issue.
- Before posting a new one, please make sure to check the previous entries on the thread AND THE ENTRIES on #1 and make a quick search; please don't reiterate requests that had already been either accepted for inclusion or disregarded.
- There's really no point on making feature requests for anything included or planned for inclusion in ACE2, AGM or CSE. The majority of those things are been considered for porting or rewriting already.
- Accepted feature requests may be moved to a separate issue by moderators for further discussion.
